# diff-view

-   Would provide file tree outline for
    [unified diff](https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Unified-Format.html) files;
-   Could provide side-by-side diff view;
-   Explore if [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) binaries could be small
    enough to be considered for distribution.
